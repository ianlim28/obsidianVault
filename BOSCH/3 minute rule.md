**Key Idea 1: Three-Minute Rule for Pitches**

• **Concept**: Your pitch must succeed within the first three minutes.
• **Reason**: Audiences have short attention spans and are quick to judge.
• **Strategy**: Simplify your presentation, focus on key information, and avoid gimmicks.
• **Impact**: A quick, clear pitch keeps the audience engaged and receptive.

**Key Idea 2: Audience Relay Effect**

• **Concept**: Your audience also has to pitch your idea to others.
• **Challenge**: Long presentations are hard to relay accurately.
• **Solution**: A concise, three-minute pitch is easier for your audience to remember and communicate.
• **Outcome**: Simplifying your pitch ensures it can be effectively passed along, increasing the chances of broader approval.

**Key Idea 3: Selective Content**

• **Concept**: You don’t need to say everything in a pitch.
• **Approach**: Be selective and focus on the most crucial information.
• **Strategy**: Convey the general concept to pique interest, then delve into details later.
• **Result**: A concise pitch avoids overwhelming the audience and keeps them interested.

**Key Idea 4: Four Essential Questions**

• **Questions to Answer**:
1. What is it?
2. How does it work?
3. Are you sure?
4. Can you do it?

• **Purpose**: These questions help structure your pitch and address key concerns.
• **Execution**: Provide clear, concise answers to build credibility and interest.

**Key Idea 5: Broad Interpretation of Questions**

• **Strategy**: Reinterpret the four main questions to cover a broader range of related queries.
• **Execution**: Tailor your answers to anticipate and address specific audience concerns.
• **Impact**: This approach ensures comprehensive coverage and keeps the audience engaged.

**Key Idea 6: Focus on Key Information**

• **Approach**: Include only the most important and interesting information.
• **Process**: Create concise answers to the main questions, then filter out less compelling details.
• **Goal**: Use the most impactful information to fill your three-minute pitch.

**Key Idea 7: Opening with Your “Aha” Moment**

• **Concept**: Start your pitch with your reason for being – your “aha” moment.
• **Example**: Share a personal story that highlights your connection to the idea.
• **Result**: This creates a strong, relatable opening that captures attention.

  

**Key Idea 8: Use a Callback**

• **Concept**: Reinforce your opening with a callback later in the pitch.
• **Execution**: Share an anecdote that confirms your initial insight.
• **Impact**: A well-placed callback solidifies your narrative and strengthens your message.

**Key Idea 9: Address Skepticism Early**

• **Strategy**: Acknowledge potential problems upfront.
• **Execution**: Present challenges and how you’ve overcome them.
• **Outcome**: This builds credibility, reduces audience skepticism, and keeps them focused on your solution.

  

**Key Idea 10: Finish with a Hook and Edge**

• **Hook**: The most exciting element of your pitch.
• **Edge**: A vivid illustration of the hook.
• **Execution**: Introduce the hook after explaining the core concept, then use the edge to reinforce it.
• **Result**: Ending with a strong hook and edge ensures your pitch leaves a lasting impression.

**Conclusion**
A successful pitch adheres to the three-minute rule, answers key questions clearly, addresses skepticism, and ends with a compelling hook and edge. By focusing on essential information and structuring your pitch effectively, you maximize your chances of success.
