> Most projects will disappoint because the project plan underestimates the effort, uses high-level requirements, assumes no problems and overestimates the capability of the team. [Most software projects are underestimated](https://blog.devgenius.io/Most%20software%C2%A0projects%20are%20underestimated)

> Plans tell you about the desired project delivery date but nothing about the actual project delivery date. Project plans say they will finish the project on time and on budget. Project plans are what everyone involved wants to hear.

Software projects are tough, they need people to work hard and make decisive decisions when the project doesn’t go to plan.

Most people aren’t used to thing going wrong, the natural reaction is to try and make the time up and create an aggressive plan that won’t work.

Instead face the brutal truth of the situation and create a realistic plan because constant replanning drains confidence and lowers morale. The people working on the project know a bad plan when they see one, so make a realistic plan instead that the team have a chance of delivering.
