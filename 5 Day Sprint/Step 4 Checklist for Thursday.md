_Note: Schedules are approximate. Don’t worry if you run behind. Remember to take breaks every sixty to ninety minutes (or around 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. each day)._

## 10 a.m.

- **Pick the right tools.** Don’t use your everyday tools. They’re optimized for quality. Instead, use tools that are rough, fast, and flexible. (Read more on page 186 in [_Sprint_](http://amzn.to/1S7QdAn).)

- **Divide and conquer.** Assign roles: Maker, Stitcher, Writer, Asset Collector, and Interviewer. You can also break the storyboard into smaller scenes and assign each to different team members. (p. 187)

- **Prototype!**

## 1 p.m.

- **Lunch**

## 2 p.m.

- **Prototype!**

- **Stitch it together.** With the work split into parts, it’s easy to lose track of the whole. The Stitcher checks for quality and ensures all the pieces make sense together. (p. 189)

## 3-ish

- **Do a trial run.** Run through your prototype. Look for mistakes. Make sure the Interviewer and the ==Decider== see it. (p. 189)

- **Finish up the prototype.**

## Throughout the Day

- **Write interview script.** The Interviewer prepares for Friday’s test by writing a script. (p. 188)

- **Remind customers to show up for Friday’s test.** Email is good, phone call is better.

- **Buy gift cards for customers.** We usually use $100 gift cards.

## Key Ideas

- **Prototype mindset.** You can prototype anything. Prototypes are disposable. Build just enough to learn, but not more. The prototype must appear real. (p. 168)
- **Goldilocks quality.** Create a prototype with just enough quality to evoke honest reactions from customers. (p. 170)
