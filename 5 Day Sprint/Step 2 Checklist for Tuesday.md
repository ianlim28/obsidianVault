_Note: Schedules are approximate. Don’t worry if you run behind. Remember to take breaks every sixty to ninety minutes (or around 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. each day)._

## 10 a.m.

- **Lightning Demos**. Look at great solutions from a range of companies, including yours. Three minutes per demo. Capture good ideas with a quick drawing on the whiteboard. (Read more on page 96 in [_Sprint_](http://amzn.to/1SMXXaM).)

## 12:30-ish

- **Divide or swarm**. Decide who will sketch which part of the map. If you’re targeting a big chunk of the map in your sprint, divide it up and assign someone to each section. (p. 102)

## 1 p.m.

- **Lunch**

## 2 p.m.

- **The Four-Step Sketch**. Briefly explain the four steps. Everyone sketches. When you’re done, place the sketches in a pile and save them for tomorrow. (p. 109)

1. **Notes**. Twenty minutes. Silently walk around the room and gather notes. (p. 110)
2. **Ideas**. Twenty minutes. Privately jot down some rough ideas. Circle the most promising ones. (p. 111)
3. **Crazy 8s**. Eight minutes. Fold a sheet of paper to create eight frames. Sketch a variation of one of your best ideas in each frame. Spend one minute per sketch. (p. 111)
4. **Solution sketch**. Thirty to ninety minutes. Create a three-panel storyboard by sketching in three sticky notes on a sheet of paper. Make it self-explanatory. Keep it anonymous. Ugly is okay. Words matter. Give it a catchy title. (p. 114)

## Key Ideas

- **Remix and improve**. Every great invention is built on existing ideas. (p. 96)
- **Anyone can sketch**. Most solution sketches are just rectangles and words. (p. 104)
- **Concrete beats abstract**. Use sketches to turn abstract ideas into concrete solutions that can be assessed by others. (p. 106)
- **Work alone together**. Group brainstorms don’t work. Instead, give each person time to develop solutions on his or her own. (p. 107)

## Recruit Customers for Friday’s Test

- **Put someone in charge of recruiting**. It will take an extra one or two hours of work each day during the sprint. (p. 119)

- **Recruit on Craigslist**. Post a generic ad that will appeal to a wide audience. Offer compensation (we use a $100 gift card). Link to the screener survey. (p. 119)

- **Write a screener survey**. Ask questions that will help you identify your target customers, but don’t reveal who you’re looking for. (p. 120)

- **Recruit customers through your network**. If you need experts or existing customers, use your network to find customers. (p. 122)

. **Follow up with email and phone calls**. Throughout the week, make contact with each customer to make sure he or she shows up on Friday.
