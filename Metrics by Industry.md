### E-Commerce Metrics for a Google AdWords Campaign

As an e-commerce business, particularly in the competitive insurance sector, understanding and monitoring key advertising metrics is crucial. Here’s a breakdown of essential metrics for a life insurance company's Google AdWords campaign that started seven days ago:

Acquisition > Conversion > Repurchase > Size
#### 1. **Cost Per Click (CPC)**
- **Definition:** The average cost you pay each time a user clicks on your ad.
- **Current Metric:** $65.73 per click.
- **Context:** This cost is relatively high due to the competitive nature of insurance ads, but it aligns with the high customer value in the insurance industry.
- **Strategy:** Set a maximum CPC in AdWords, allowing Google’s auction system to optimize ad placement and actual CPC costs based on this limit.

#### 2. **Cost Per Mille (CPM)**
- **Definition:** The cost per thousand impressions, indicating the amount paid every time an ad is displayed 1,000 times.
- **Current Metric:** $195.87 per thousand impressions.
- **Analysis:** Deciding between CPC and CPM models depends on the expected ROI. Opting for CPM might be more cost-effective if the ad design is likely to yield a high conversion rate—more than three clicks per thousand impressions.

#### 3. **Saturation**
- **Metrics Tracked:** Reach (unique users) and frequency (average impression frequency per user).
- **Current Metrics:** 95,827 unique users with an average impression frequency of 2.6 over the seven days.
- **Implications:** These figures help gauge the breadth and repetition of ad exposure among potential customers, crucial for assessing campaign reach and optimizing frequency to avoid ad fatigue.

#### 4. **Engagement**
- **Overview:** Traditional search engine ads measure engagement primarily through click rates.
- **Advanced Ad Types:** For more interactive ad formats like Lightbox or video ads, Google tracks additional engagement metrics such as ad expansions or interactions with video elements.
- **Current Status:** While basic search ads like ours don’t offer detailed engagement stats beyond clicks, understanding engagement in more interactive ad types can guide future campaign strategies to enhance user interaction.

**New User behaviour** will dictate your **acquisition strategy**
**Returning user** behaviour dictates your **retention campaign strategy**

### What to Track in E-Commerce

E-commerce involves selling goods online through an online store. In this environment, product managers often take on roles similar to marketers, focusing heavily on metrics that gauge user interaction, conversion, and retention. Here’s a breakdown of essential e-commerce metrics grouped into four main categories:

#### 1. **Acquisition Metrics**
These metrics focus on how customers find your online store and their initial interaction with your marketing efforts.
- **CPC (Cost Per Click):** Measures the cost incurred every time a user clicks on your ad. It’s crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of paid advertising campaigns.
- **CPM (Cost Per Mille):** Reflects the cost per 1000 impressions. This metric helps understand the broader reach of your ads.
- **Saturation:** Indicates the frequency with which potential customers see your ads before they engage or click through. This helps in optimizing ad exposure to avoid fatigue and improve engagement.

#### 2. **Conversion Metrics**
Conversion metrics track the effectiveness of converting visitors into paying customers.
- **Conversion Rate by Origin Source:** Measures how different traffic sources contribute to sales, helping to identify the most profitable channels.
- **Conversion Rate by Device Type:** With 61.7% of e-commerce traffic coming from mobile devices, tracking conversion by device type can pinpoint where user experience improvements are needed.
- **Conversion Rate by Product/SKU:** Understanding which products convert best can guide inventory and marketing strategies.
- **New vs. Returning User Conversion:** Differentiates between the buying behaviors of new versus returning customers.
- **Funnel Abandonment Metrics:** Tracks how often users abandon their shopping cart without making a purchase, with an industry average cart abandonment rate around 70%.

#### 3. **Repurchase and Retention Metrics**
These metrics assess customer loyalty and the likelihood of repeat purchases.
- **Percentage of Returning Users:** Tracks how many customers return to make additional purchases and how often.
- **Frequency of Returns:** Measures the regularity of return visits, providing insight into customer loyalty and satisfaction.

#### 4. **Size Metrics (Cart Size)**
Size metrics evaluate the monetary value of purchases.
- **AOV (Average Order Value):** The average dollar amount spent each time a customer places an order. AOV can be segmented by device type, source, user type (new vs. returning), and by product, to gain insights into purchasing patterns and preferences.

### Why These Metrics Matter

Tracking these metrics allows e-commerce businesses to:
- **Optimize Marketing Spend:** By understanding which channels and tactics yield the highest ROI.
- **Enhance User Experience:** By identifying and rectifying pain points in the buying process.
- **Increase Customer Loyalty:** By monitoring and improving factors that influence repeat purchases.
- **Maximize Profitability:** By strategically adjusting product offerings and pricing based on detailed analytics.

### Detailed Analysis of Average Order Value (AOV) by Segments for an Online Toy Company

**Overview:** Average order value (AOV) is a critical metric in e-commerce that helps businesses understand their customers' purchasing behaviors. By segmenting AOV by device type, source, user type, and first product seen, an online toy company can tailor strategies to optimize revenue.

#### 1. **AOV by Device Type:**
- **Mobile Users:** AOV = $47.19
- **Tablet Users:** AOV = $49.96
- **Computer Users:** AOV = $54.12
- **Insight:** Customers using computers tend to spend more per order compared to those on mobile devices and tablets. This might be due to the easier navigation and viewing experience on computers which could encourage more confident and higher-value purchases.

#### 2. **AOV by Source:**
- **Social Media:** AOV = $39.58
- **Search Engines:** AOV = $65.93
- **Email Marketing:** AOV = $51.02
- **Analysis:** The significantly higher AOV from search engine sources suggests that customers from these channels may have a higher intent to purchase, possibly due to the targeted nature of search advertising. Conversely, social media sources yield the lowest AOV, which may indicate more impulse buying of cheaper products.

#### 3. **AOV by User Type:**
- **Returning Users:** AOV = $56.19
- **New Users:** AOV = $50.78
- **Implication:** Returning users spend more on average than new users, which might be due to familiarity with the brand or satisfaction from previous purchases. This suggests a potential for increased profitability in focusing on customer retention strategies.

#### 4. **AOV by First Product Seen:**
- **Playing Cards:** AOV = $16.98
- **Millennium Falcon Lego Set:** AOV = $431.84
- **Observation:** There's a vast difference in AOV depending on the first product the customer interacts with. High-priced items significantly boost AOV, indicating that initial product presentation can sway overall spending patterns.

### Strategic Implications and Actions:

1. **Optimize Marketing Spend:**
    - **Focus on High-ROI Channels:** Considering the disparity in AOV by source, reallocating budget towards search engine marketing could enhance overall profitability, despite its higher costs. The return from a higher AOV might justify the investment.
2. **Enhance User Experience on Computers:**
    - **Website Optimization:** Given that computer users have the highest AOV, enhancing the desktop user experience could further increase spending. This includes improving site navigation, speed, and checkout process.
3. **Targeted Product Marketing:**
    - **Promote High-Value Products:** Marketing more expensive items, like the Millennium Falcon Lego set, could be lucrative. However, consider the balance between product promotion costs and the expected increase in AOV.
4. **Develop Customer Retention Programs:**
    - **Loyalty Rewards:** Since returning users have a higher AOV, developing loyalty programs or offering exclusive deals could encourage repeat purchases and increase lifetime value.

3. **Fragmentation:**
    - **High Fragmentation:** Many users engaging in small transactions.
    - **Low Fragmentation:** Few users responsible for a large portion of transactions.
    - **Purpose:** Understanding fragmentation helps in assessing the marketplace’s competitive environment and potential vulnerabilities.
