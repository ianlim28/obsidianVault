<h2>The pyschopathology of everyday things</h2>

1. **Design Critique**: Norman opens the chapter by discussing the frustration and difficulties people encounter when trying to use common objects, such as doors, stovetops, or VCRs. He points out that users often blame themselves for their difficulties instead of recognizing that poorly designed objects are the root cause.

2. **The Gulf of Evaluation**: Norman introduces the concept of the "Gulf of Evaluation," which refers to the cognitive gap between the user's understanding of an object's state and the feedback provided by the object. When this gap is too large, users struggle to understand how to interact with the object effectively.
   
3. **The Gulf of Execution**: Similarly, the "Gulf of Execution" represents the gap between the user's intentions and the necessary actions to accomplish a task. If the gulf is wide, users may not be able to translate their goals into action due to poor design.
   
4. **Affordances**: Norman introduces the concept of "affordances" as the perceived or actual properties of an object that suggest how it can be used. For example, a button affords pushing, while a handle affords pulling. Good design should make these affordances clear and intuitive.
   
5. **Signifiers**: Signifiers are cues or indicators that help users understand how to interact with an object. They provide feedback about the system's state and possible actions. For instance, a light switch's position signifies whether the light is on or off. Norman stresses the importance of clear and effective signifiers in design.
   
6. **Mapping**: Norman discusses the concept of "mapping" in design, which refers to the relationship between controls and their functions. An example of good mapping is a stove with four burners aligned with four corresponding dials, making it easy to understand which dial controls which burner.
   
7. **Feedback**: Feedback is essential in design, as it informs users of the system's response to their actions. Effective feedback helps bridge the Gulf of Evaluation. Norman emphasizes that good feedback should be immediate, informative, and easy to interpret.

| I’m frustrated; people aren’t using our application properly.|Can you tell me about it? |
|The screen shows the restaurant that we recommend. It matches their preferences, and their friends like it as well. If they want to see other recommendations, all they have to do is swipe left or right. To learn more about a place, just swipe up for a menu or down to see if any friends are there now. People seem to find the other recommendations, but not the menus or their friends? I don’t understand. | Why do you think this might be? |
|I don’t k now. Should I add some affordances? Suppose I put an arrow on each edge and add a label saying what they do.| That is very nice. But why do you call these affordances? They could already do the actions. Weren’t the affordances already there? |
| Yes, you have a point. But the affordances weren’t visible. I made them visible.| Very true. You added a signal of what to do.|
|Yes, isn't that what i said? | Not quite—you called them affordances even though they afford nothing new: they signify what to do and where to do it. So call them by their right name: “signifiers.” |
| Yes, isn’t that what I said? Oh, I see. But then why do designers care about affordances? Perhaps we should focus our attention on signifiers. | You speak wisely. Communication is a key to good design. And a key to communication is the signifier. Profound ideas are always obvious once they are understood. |
