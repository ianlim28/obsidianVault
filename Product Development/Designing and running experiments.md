### Understanding MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
#mvp
**Origins and Definition:**
- **Introduction:** The term 'MVP' was first introduced by Eric Ries in the context of the Lean Startup framework.
- **Definition:** "A Minimum Viable Product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort."

**Purpose of an MVP:**
- **Core Idea:** To build the smallest version of a product with the least amount of resources to test if the concept is viable.
- **Validated Learning:** This approach is akin to a scientific experiment where interactions are designed to be unbiased to garner genuine customer feedback.

**Philosophy of 'Fail Fast':**
- **Objective:** Conduct multiple experiments quickly to gather data, iterate, and determine the most effective version of the product.
- **Outcome:** This rapid iteration cycle helps in quickly pivoting or modifying the approach based on real user feedback.

### MVP Strategy for Product Managers

**Role in Larger Organizations:**
- **Risk Tolerance:** Typically, larger organizations can absorb the impact of a failed MVP better than startups due to more extensive resources.
- **Brand Considerations:** Product managers must weigh the potential brand impact of a failed product against the organizational tolerance for risk.
- **Potential Benefits:** Even failed products can provide valuable learning experiences that might benefit the organization in unexpected ways.

**7 Steps of an MVP Experiment:**
1. **Define the Problem/Solution Set:**
    - Identify the core customer problem and propose a viable solution.
2. **Identify Key Assumptions:**
    - Pinpoint assumptions underlying the product’s success and identify which are the riskiest.
3. **Build Testable Hypotheses:**
    - Create hypotheses around your key assumptions that can be tested empirically.
4. **Establish Success Criteria:**
    - Define what success looks like for the MVP, setting minimum thresholds for performance and user acceptance.
5. **Choose MVP Type and Strategy:**
    - Decide on the type of MVP (e.g., a product feature set, a service, or a prototype) and plan the implementation strategy.
6. **Execute the MVP Experiment:**
    - Implement the MVP based on the strategy planned, ensuring resources are used efficiently and effectively.
7. **Evaluate and Learn from the Experiment:**
    - Analyze the outcomes, gather insights, and learn from the data collected to inform future product development cycles.

**Summary:** Implementing an MVP is a critical strategy for both validating product-market fit and learning directly from user interactions with minimal resources. It is especially important for product managers to carefully design these experiments to align with broader organizational goals and risk management strategies.

**Understanding Assumptions:**
- Assumptions are beliefs that we accept as true without concrete evidence. In the context of product development, these are preconceived notions about what customers want, need, or how they behave.
- Recognizing these assumptions is crucial because they form the foundation on which business strategies and product decisions are made.

**The Importance of Testing Assumptions:**
- Untested assumptions can lead to misinformed decisions and potentially costly mistakes. It’s vital to validate these assumptions through empirical data to ensure they reflect reality.

**How to Identify Your Assumptions:**

1. **Start with a Hypothetical Statement:**
    - Frame your assumptions by starting with the phrase, “In order for my idea to be successful, the following must be true…” This helps in directly aligning your assumptions with your business or product goals.
2. **List Key Beliefs About Your Product and Market:**
    - **Customer Problems:** Write down what you believe are your customers' main problems (e.g., "My customer has x, y, z problem").
    - **Value Proposition:** Specify what aspects of your product are crucial to your customers (e.g., "____ matters to my customers").
    - **Willingness to Pay:** Assume financial behaviors of your potential customers (e.g., "___ will pay for this product").
    - **Market Conditions:** Consider the competitive landscape (e.g., "There are no satisfactory substitutes").

**Examples of Common Assumptions in Product Development:**
- **Customer Needs and Desires:** Assuming specific pain points or desires without evidence can mislead the product design.
- **Market Demand:** Presuming there is a demand for the product without market validation.
- **Price Sensitivity:** Overestimating or underestimating how much customers are willing to pay.
- **Competitive Advantage:** Assuming the product has no direct competitors or substitutes.

**Strategies for Testing Assumptions:**
- **Customer Interviews:** Directly asking potential users about their needs and behaviors.
- **Market Surveys:** Gathering broader insights through structured questionnaires.
- **Prototype Testing:** Offering a minimal version of the product to gauge user interaction and feedback.
- **Competitive Analysis:** Examining the market to understand competitors’ strengths and weaknesses.

**Summary:** Identifying and challenging your assumptions is a critical step in the lean startup methodology. It involves scrutinizing every belief about your business and product strategy to ensure they are grounded in reality. The goal is to minimize risk and align your business strategy with actual market conditions and customer needs.


### Identifying the Riskiest Assumption in Product Development
**[How to diagnose your riskiest assumptions](https://dkander.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/how-to-diagnose-your-riskiest-assumptions/)**
**Concept Overview:**
- When developing a new product, you are often working with multiple assumptions that you believe to be true about your customers, market, and product functionality. It's critical to identify and test these assumptions to ensure they are accurate.

**Focus on the Riskiest Assumption:**
- **Definition:** The riskiest assumption is the assumption that, if proven false, would most significantly jeopardize the success of your product. This is typically related to a fundamental aspect of your product's value proposition.
- **Strategic Importance:** Prioritizing this assumption saves resources and time by addressing the biggest potential failure point early in the development process.

**Commonly Risky Assumption:**
- **Problem Existence:** Often, the most critical and riskiest assumption is that the problem you are aiming to solve with your product actually exists for your target customers.
    - If the assumed problem is not genuine or pressing for the target audience, the product is likely to fail because it does not address a real need or pain point.

**Examples of Risky Assumptions:**
- **Customer Need:** Believing that customers have a specific problem that your product solves. If customers do not actually experience this problem, they will have no interest in your product.
- **Market Demand:** Assuming there is a demand for your solution in the current market. Lack of demand means the product will not achieve expected sales or adoption.
- **Product Functionality:** Presuming that the product works in a way that satisfactorily solves the customer's problem. If the solution is ineffective, customer satisfaction and product uptake will be low.

**Strategies for Testing the Riskiest Assumption:**
1. **Lean Experimentation:**
    - Develop small, focused experiments or minimum viable products (MVPs) that directly test whether the assumed problem is significant to your target audience.
2. **Customer Discovery Interviews:**
    - Conduct in-depth discussions with potential users to validate whether the problem you perceive is genuine and pressing.
3. **Early Prototyping:**
    - Create early versions of your product with essential features to test assumptions about product functionality and user interaction.
4. **Market Analysis:**
    - Conduct competitive analysis and market research to assess the existence and intensity of demand for the solution you are proposing.

**Summary:** Focusing on the riskiest assumption allows teams to efficiently use resources by quickly validating or invalidating the core hypothesis underlying the product's expected success. This approach reduces the risk of lengthy and costly development for a product that may not meet market needs or customer expectations.

### The Risk/Difficulty Square in Decision Making

**Overview:** The risk/difficulty square is a strategic tool used by companies, especially in large organizations, to prioritize testing assumptions based on their risk to the product or company and the difficulty of testing them.

**Defining Risk and Difficulty:**
- **Risk:** Measures how critical an assumption is to the success of the product. High risk means that if the assumption is incorrect, it could significantly impact the project negatively.
- **Difficulty:** Refers to the amount of effort, resources, and time required to validate an assumption. High difficulty implies significant investment and complex testing.

**Utilizing the Risk/Difficulty Square:** This model categorizes assumptions into four quadrants based on their levels of risk and difficulty:
![[Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 07.29.31.png]]
1. **High Risk / Low Difficulty:**
    - **Priority:** These are the assumptions that should be tested first. Since they pose a high risk but are relatively easy to test, addressing these can yield significant insights with relatively little effort.
2. **High Risk / High Difficulty:** (larger commitment)
    - **Sequence:** After addressing the high risk/low difficulty assumptions, focus shifts to those that are both high risk and high difficulty. These require more resources and careful planning but are crucial due to their potential impact on the project.
3. **Low Risk / Low Difficulty:**
    - **Testing:** Assumptions that fall into this category are tested afterwards. They are easier and less costly to validate and, while they pose lower risk, the insights gained can still contribute positively to the project.
4. **Low Risk / High Difficulty:**
    - **Avoidance:** Assumptions in this quadrant are generally avoided or left untested unless all other higher priority tests are completed. The high effort required to test these low-impact assumptions typically does not justify the resources.

**Implementing the Risk/Difficulty Square:**
- **Visual Tool:** It is useful to visually map out assumptions on a grid to see where they fall within these categories. This helps in strategic planning and resource allocation.
- **Decision Making:** The risk/difficulty square helps managers and teams make informed decisions about where to focus their testing efforts, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and effectively.

**Example of Application:** Imagine a technology company developing a new software tool. They might use the risk/difficulty square to decide whether to first test the software's core functionality (high risk, low difficulty) or its integration with other tools (high risk, high difficulty), while deprioritizing customization options (low risk, high difficulty).

**Summary:** Using the risk/difficulty square as a framework allows teams to systematically prioritize testing based on the potential impact and required effort. This strategic approach helps in managing resources wisely and mitigating risks effectively in product development.

### Understanding Hypotheses in Product Development

**Definition and Purpose:**
- A **hypothesis** is a specific, testable statement formulated based on identified assumptions about a product or market. It articulates a belief about what is expected to happen when a particular variable is manipulated during an experiment, such as in an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) test.
- Formulating hypotheses is essential for conducting scientific experiments, including those in product development, as they guide the testing of assumptions and help in validating product concepts.

**Characteristics of a Hypothesis:**
- **Actionable:** A hypothesis should be directly testable through specific actions taken during product testing or customer interaction.
- **Targeted:** It should specify a target group whose behavior or preferences are under study.
- **Outcome-Focused:** It should predict a specific outcome or change resulting from the proposed action.
- **Strategic:** It often includes a strategy to engage customers or modify the product to elicit the predicted behavior or outcome.

**Formulating a Basic Hypothesis:**

- **Structure:** "We believe [target group of people] will [predicted action] because [reason]."
    - This format works well for entrepreneurs or when developing new products. It connects a potential problem or benefit with a target action by the specified group.

**Advanced Hypothesis for Product Management:**

- **More Complex Formulation:** "If we [action], we believe [subject] will [predicted action/outcome] because [reason]."
    - This structure is used to make predictions about how changes to an existing product will affect user behavior or product performance.
- **Detailed Product Management Hypothesis:** "We believe [subject] has a [problem] because [reason]. If we [action], this [metric] will improve."
    - This formulation adds specificity by including a measurable metric, which is crucial for evaluating the success of the hypothesis in quantitative terms.

**Examples:**
1. **Startup Hypothesis:** "We believe urban commuters will use our app to find quicker public transit routes because it reduces their daily commute time."
2. **Product Management Hypothesis:** "We believe users are not completing purchases because the checkout process is too complicated. If we simplify the checkout interface, our conversion rate will increase by 15%."

**Why Specificity Matters:**
- **Focus:** More specific hypotheses allow for more focused and measurable experiments, making it easier to validate or refute the assumptions.
- **Metrics-Driven:** Product managers especially benefit from hypotheses that are tightly coupled with metrics, as this aligns closely with performance indicators that businesses track.

**Summary:** A well-crafted hypothesis is crucial for effective product testing and development. It bridges the gap between theoretical assumptions and practical, measurable experiments, providing a clear direction for MVP experiments and subsequent adjustments based on empirical data.

Steps:
1. List out ALL your assumptions, list alllll your assumptions
2. pick out the riskiest assumptions 
WHO: 30-50 year olds who have cars
ACTION: Let an on demand valet park their car

### Understanding Minimum Criteria for Success (MCS) in MVP Testing

**Overview:** Minimum Criteria for Success (MCS) is a framework used in product development to determine whether an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) test is successful. MCS helps guide decisions on whether a product idea is worth pursuing based on predefined success metrics.

**Possible Outcomes of an MVP Test:**
1. **Hypothesis Proven False:** The test conclusively demonstrates that the initial assumptions were incorrect.
2. **Hypothesis Proven True:** The test validates the assumptions as correct.
3. **Indeterminate Outcome:** The results are ambiguous, which is common in about 90% of cases.

**The Role of MCS:**
- MCS provides clarity and meaning to MVP experiments by setting specific benchmarks that define success or failure.
- Establishing MCS is crucial because it helps teams decide whether further investment in a product is justified based on the test outcomes.

**Setting Your MCS:**

1. **Consider Cost vs. Reward:**
    - **Costs:** Include all expenses associated with developing the MVP, such as developer salaries, your time, labor wages, advertising costs, brand impact, and opportunity costs.
    - **Rewards:** Define potential benefits like increased revenue, user engagement metrics (e.g., time spent on page, number of shares), and customer lifetime value (LTV).
2. **Identify Key Metrics:**
    - Determine which metrics will best indicate customer interest and potential success. These might include conversion rates, open rates, or any other metric that aligns with your business goals.
3. **Economic Viability:**
    - Ensure that the anticipated rewards of the product exceed its costs. This assessment will determine if the product is economically viable.

**Creating a Formula for MCS:**

- **Example Calculation:**
    - **Development Costs:** Calculate the total investment required for building the MVP. For instance:
        - Two developers for two weeks, each earning $100K per year: Approx. $8K in labor costs.
        - Your involvement for two weeks adds an additional $2K.
        - Marketing expenses (e.g., ads to generate traffic): $3K.
        - **Total Cost:** $13K.
    - **Opportunity Cost:** Consider what else could be achieved with the same resources and time.
- **Benefit Threshold:**
    - Define the specific improvements in targeted metrics that would justify these costs. For example, a significant increase in user engagement or a specific number of new customer sign-ups.
- **Metric Focus:**
    - Choose a primary metric to focus on that directly relates to revenue or critical business objectives, such as "increased time on site leads to increased revenue."

**Summary:** MCS is a strategic tool that quantifies the success of an MVP test by comparing the cost of development against the measurable benefits. This approach ensures that product development decisions are grounded in economic reality and business strategy, rather than intuition alone. By focusing on specific, quantifiable metrics, businesses can more effectively manage resources and direct efforts towards the most promising product ideas.

### Setting MCS in Startups

**Overview:** Startups typically focus on validation metrics when setting their Minimum Criteria for Success (MCS). These metrics demonstrate real interest from potential customers and help assess the economic viability of the project.

**Key Considerations for MCS in Startups:**
- **Validation Metrics:** Metrics such as the number of shares or the percentage of visitors who sign up are crucial. These indicate genuine customer interest and potential for scale.
- **Economic Viability:** Given the higher risks associated with new products, startups need to ensure that the MCS reflects the project's potential to be economically sustainable.

**Common MVP Formats for Startups:** Startups often use MVPs to simulate and test how real users would interact with a potential product. The goal is to gather validated learning from genuine customer feedback by presenting the product as "coming soon" or already existing.

**Types of MVPs:**

1. **Email MVP:**
    - **Description:** Utilizes an email client and a list to pitch a new product concept.
    - **Process:** By sending out emails that introduce the product, startups can gauge interest based on the response rate and engagement.
    - **Setup:** Startups without an existing email list might need to gather emails first, using engaging content that avoids spam filters.
2. **Shadow Button MVP:**
    - **Description:** Involves displaying a button for a new feature on the product’s interface.
    - **Functionality:** When users click the button, they might be redirected to a page that states the feature is coming soon or the link may appear broken.
    - **Insight:** The number of clicks provides a direct measure of user interest in the new feature.
3. **404 and Coming Soon Page MVP:**
    - **Description:** This type simulates the addition of a new feature. Users are directed to a page that either shows a 404 error or a coming soon message.
    - **Purpose:** Encourages users to sign up for updates, helping to measure anticipation and demand.
    - **Example:** Amazon frequently employs this type of MVP to test interest in potential new features or services.

**Implementing MCS with MVPs:**
- When setting MCS using these MVP types, startups must define specific, measurable goals. For instance, a successful Email MVP might be defined by a 20% sign-up rate from the emails sent, while a Shadow Button MVP might target a certain number of clicks as indicative of interest.

**Summary:** In startups, the MCS must not only reflect interest through validation metrics but also consider the broader economic implications of pursuing the product development. Different types of MVPs provide versatile, low-cost methods for testing hypotheses and measuring customer interest effectively, enabling startups to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with full-scale development.

2. **Engage Cross-Functional Teams:** Utilize the broad skill sets available within the organization to ensure the MVP is well-rounded and considers all relevant aspects—technical, business, and customer experience.
3. **Monitor Impact on Brand:** Continuously assess how the MVP is perceived by users and the impact on the brand, adjusting strategies as necessary to protect the company’s image.

### Summary
In large companies, the approach to MVPs is characterized by a strategic balance between innovation and brand integrity. The ability to leverage substantial resources has to be tempered with a responsibility to uphold the brand's reputation and ensure that any product development efforts add real value to the company and its customers.

### Evaluating and Learning from Your MVP Experiment

**Overview of the Process:**
1. **Come Up With an Idea:** Begin with a clear, actionable hypothesis based on identified needs or opportunities.
2. **Design the Experiment:** Plan how to test this hypothesis through an MVP that captures relevant data.
3. **Set Up Expectations:** Define what success looks like by establishing Minimum Criteria for Success (MCS).
4. **Run the Test:** Implement the MVP and collect data from interactions and feedback.

**Analyzing the Results:**

**1. Compare Data Against MCS:**
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Look at the numbers derived from the experiment—such as usage statistics, conversion rates, or other key performance indicators (KPIs). Compare these figures against your MCS to assess if the experiment met the defined success criteria.
- **Qualitative Feedback:** Incorporate insights from customer interviews and other feedback mechanisms. This qualitative data provides context to the numbers and helps understand the reasons behind user behaviors and preferences.

**2. Diagnose Performance:**
- **Identify Success Factors:** If the MVP met or exceeded the MCS, analyze which aspects worked well and why.
- **Understand Failure Points:** If the MVP did not meet the MCS, delve into the data to uncover what didn't work. Look for patterns in feedback that might explain the underperformance.

**3. Synthesize Insights:**
- **Combining Data:** Integrate both sets of data to paint a complete picture of the experiment. This holistic view helps in understanding not just what happened, but why it happened.
- **Learn from Customer Behavior:** Use qualitative data to add depth to the quantitative results, providing insights into customer motivations, frustrations, and satisfactions.

**Deciding on Next Steps:**

**1. Proceed, Pivot, or Halt:**
- **Green Light:** If the experiment was successful, consider developing the feature fully or integrating the tested product more broadly into your offerings.
- **Rerun or Pivot:** If results were inconclusive or partially successful, you might choose to rerun the experiment with adjustments based on learned insights, or pivot to a new hypothesis or product feature based on uncovered customer needs.
- **Scrap:** If the data clearly shows that your hypothesis was incorrect, or the product does not meet a real customer need, it may be best to scrap the idea and redirect resources elsewhere.
