#dataAttribute

A custom data attribute in HTML is a way to add extra information to an HTML element that is not predefined by the HTML specification. It allows developers to store additional data or metadata on an element that can be accessed by JavaScript or CSS.

The purpose of using this custom data attribute can vary depending on the specific use case. It can be used for filtering or sorting elements, storing configuration settings, or any other scenario where extra information needs to be associated with an element.
