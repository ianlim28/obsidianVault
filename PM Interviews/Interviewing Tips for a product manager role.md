##### <span style="color:orange">SITUATION</span>
In my last role as a Consultant, i was asked to help with a project that was not properly sized. ==there was almost no time left to finish the project,== it was evident that ==we== were not going to finish on time and the ==customer== was not happy about it. 
 Main Problem: There was almost no time left to finish the project
 We: Most likely will be a story about working with teams/cross-functionally
 Customer: Skill to talk about - customer centric


##### <span style="color:orange">TASK</span>
When ==i== joined the team, ==i== needed to understand the progress that the team had made, how much was left and what can we do to deliver what we promised.
I: The TASK is about your role in the situation

##### <span style="color:orange">ACTION</span>
When i joined this new team:
1. ==The First== thing ==i== did was understand the customer requirement and what was left of work
2. ==Then==, ==I== talked with the customer to understand the goal of the project we were developing to prioritise our deliverables. ==I== realised that this was just the start of what could become a bigger project - the customer needed this first step to convince the stakeholders of spending resources on their project.
3. ==Next==, ==I== drafted a proposal for the customer in which we would finish 60 to 70% of what was missing in the original scope and the rest would be part of a larger project for the next phase. We would also spend time working on designs and documents the customer could use for their presentation to the stakeholders.
4. ==Finally==, ==I== worked with the team to put together a work plan with specific dates and milestone and improve our communication with the customer through weekly status calls.

##### <span style="color:orange">RESULT</span>
As a result of this effort, the customer convinced the stakeholders to invest resources in this project. We went into a bigger phase 2 and that created a long-lasting relationship with this customer and our firm.
When i left the company, the team was working on phase 4 and other side projects started with this customer. 

##### <span style="color:orange">LESSON</span>
An important thing that i learned from this project is that it's always important to focus on understanding the customer problem and their motivation

    - Use a logical approach to calculate the numbers step by step.
    - Example: Multiply the estimated number of buildings by the number of stories and windows per story.
    - Write down your assumptions and calculations clearly.

#### Detailed Walkthrough Example: YouTube Revenue Estimation

1. **Clarify the Question:**
    
    - Region: U.S. only.
    - Type of revenue: Top-line (gross) revenue.
    - Source of revenue: Advertising only.
2. **Break Down the Numbers:**
    ![[Screenshot 2024-06-21 at 07.53.26 1.png]]
    - Estimate the size of the market: Population of the U.S.
    - Determine the percentage of YouTube users.
    - Estimate the number of advertisements viewed per user per day.
    - Estimate the revenue generated per advertisement.
3. **Perform the Estimation:**
    
    - Population of the U.S.: 330 million.
    - Percentage of YouTube users: 60%.
    - Number of users: 330 million * 0.60 = 200 million.
    - Advertisements viewed per user per day: 15.
    - Revenue per advertisement: $10.
    - Total daily revenue: 200 million * 15 * $10 = $30000 million.
4. **Bring It All Together (dont forget to wrap it up):**
    
    - Summarize the steps and the final estimation: "Based on my calculations, YouTube makes approximately $30 million per day from advertising in the U.S." Make sure you answer the question! I've had many people just tell me the number at the end, but it seems they forgot why they did the math in the first place, this could make or break your interview
    - ask your interviewer if there is anything you should go over again (this is a sneaky way of getting a second chance on something your interviewer might have found wanting in your approach)
