**Approach Overview**
1. **Breathe**: Start broad to ensure all potential reasons are considered before diving deep into specifics.

2. **Depth**: Methodically explore each category to identify root causes and actionable insights.

**Root Cause Analysis Example**
Scenario: Implemented a new feature, and three days later, signups have decreased.

**Structured Answer Example**
**Introduction**:
“In a real-life situation, we often quickly identify that a recent product launch or user experience change might be affecting a metric. While this could be the case, I prefer to take a broader look first to ensure we consider all possible reasons before diving into specifics. If it’s okay with you, I’d like to explore all potential causes and then go deeper into some areas to provide a comprehensive answer.”

**Step 1: System Issues**:
• “First, let’s examine system-related problems. We need to verify if the system logging our metrics has been functioning correctly. This can be quickly checked with our engineering team. Additionally, we should ensure that the metric calculation process hasn’t changed due to a mistake or update in the business logic.”

**Step 2: External Factors**:
• “Next, let’s consider external factors. Competitors might have launched new features that attract our users. Also, check if external websites, like Facebook, which we rely on for logins, are experiencing outages. Moreover, market trends and demographic shifts could be influencing user behavior. Finally, consider seasonal factors – for instance, signups often decrease during certain times of the year. We should determine if this drop is within expected margins.”

**Step 3: Internal Factors**:
• “Internally, we need to review any new features or products launched recently. We should analyze if the issue is device-specific or if certain products are cannibalizing others. Additionally, an increase in user-reported errors or negative feedback could provide clues.”

**Step 4: Out-of-Control Factors**:
• “Lastly, we should account for factors beyond our control, such as political changes or natural disasters that might impact user behavior.”

**Gathering More Information**:
• “To narrow it down further, I’d like to ask for more clues about what specifically happened when the metric changed. This will help us focus our investigation.”

**Deep Dive**:
• “Now that we’ve covered all categories, let’s dive deeper. I believe the recent change in our user interface might be affecting the metric. I’d like to explore this hypothesis further. For instance, checking if both iOS and Android platforms are affected could reveal if the issue is platform-specific. If only one platform is impacted, we can then check with our engineering team to see what’s different between them.”

**User Journey Analysis**:
• “Additionally, let’s examine the user journey. If a recent change, such as the placement of comments, isn’t working as expected and users can’t find important features, this could explain the drop. Collaborating with our design and engineering teams will be crucial to identify short-term fixes and long-term solutions.”

**Conclusion**:
• “By following this structured approach, we can ensure that all potential causes are considered and addressed, leading to a more effective and comprehensive solution.”
