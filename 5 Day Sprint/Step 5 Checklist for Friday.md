## Makeshift Research Lab

- **Two rooms.** In the sprint room, the sprint team will watch a video feed of the interviews. You’ll need a second, smaller room for the actual interviews. Make sure the interview room is clean and comfortable for your guests. (Read more on page 202 in [_Sprint_](http://amzn.to/1S7QdAn).)

- **Set up hardware.** Position a webcam so you can see customers’ reactions. If your customer will be using a smartphone, iPad, or other hardware device, set up a document camera and microphone.

- **Set up video stream.** Use any video-conferencing software to stream video to the sprint room. Make sure the sound quality is good. Make sure the video and audio are one-way only.

## Key Ideas

- **Five is the magic number.** After five customer interviews, big patterns will emerge. Do all five interviews in one day. (p. 197)
- **Watch together, learn together.** Don’t disband the sprint team. Watching together is more efficient, and you’ll draw better conclusions. (p. 218)
- **A winner every time.** Your prototype might be an efficient failure or a flawed success. In every case, you’ll learn what you need for the next step. (p. 223)

## Five-Act Interview

1. **Friendly welcome.** Welcome the customer and put him or her at ease. Explain that you’re looking for candid feedback. (p. 204)
2. **Context questions.** Start with easy small talk, then transition to questions about the topic you’re trying to learn about. (p. 205)
3. **Introduce the prototype.** Remind the customer that some things might not work, and that you’re not testing him or her. Ask the customer to think aloud. (p. 206)
4. **Tasks and nudges.** Watch the customer figure out the prototype on his or her own. Start with a simple nudge. Ask follow-up questions to help the customer think aloud. (p. 208)
5. **Debrief.** Ask questions that prompt the customer to summarize. Then thank the customer, give him or her a gift card, and show the customer out. (p. 209)

## Interviewer Tips

- **Be a good host.** Throughout the interview, keep the customer’s comfort in mind. Use body language to make yourself friendlier. Smile! (p. 212)
- **Ask open-ended questions.** Ask “Who/What/Where/When/Why/How?” questions. Don’t ask leading “yes/no” or multiple-choice questions. (p. 212)
- **Ask broken questions.** Allow your speech to trail off before you finish a question. Silence encourages the customer to talk without creating any bias. (p. 214)
- **Curiosity mindset.** Be authentically fascinated by your customer’s reactions and thoughts. (p. 215)

Meanwhile, in the sprint room, the team watches the interviews over a live video feed and takes notes.

## Before the First Interview

- **Draw a grid on a whiteboard.** Create a column for each customer. Then add a row for each prototype or section of prototype. (p. 219)

## During Each Interview

- **Take notes as you watch.** Hand out sticky notes and markers. Write down direct quotes, observations, and interpretations. Indicate positive or negative. (p. 219)

## After Each Interview

- **Stick up notes.** Stick your interview notes in the correct row and column on the whiteboard grid. Briefly discuss the interview, but wait to draw conclusions. (p. 220)

- **Take a quick break.**

## At the End of the Day

- **Look for patterns.** At the end of the day, read the board in silence and write down patterns. Make a list of all the patterns people noticed. Label each as positive, negative, or neutral. (p. 222)

- **Wrap up.** Review your long-term goal and your sprint questions. Compare with the patterns you saw in the interviews. Decide how to follow-up after the sprint. Write it down. (p. 222)
