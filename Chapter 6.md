<h2>Design Thinking </h2>
Never solve the problem you are asked to solve. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all. Solve the correct problem

HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN (HSD)
 process of ensuring that people's needs are met, that the resulting product is understandable and usable, that it accomplishes the desired tasks, and that the experience of use is positive and enjoyable. 

**Designers never start by trying to solve the problem given to them they start by trying to understand what the real issues are as a result rather than converge upon a solution they diverge that in people and what they are trying to accomplish generating idea of the idea after idea**

**idea generation**
- Numerous ideas
- Be creative without regard for constraints

Question everything
- a stupid question asked about things so fundamental that everyone assumes the answer is obvious but when the question is taken seriously often turns out to be profound

Prototyping
Testing

**Human centered design versus  activity centered**

Focus on activities not the individual person let the activity  defined the product and its structure let the conceptual model of the product we built around the conceptual model objectivity 

Activity is a high level structure perhaps go shopping task is a lower level component of an activity such as drive to the market buying a shopping basket activity is a collected set of tasks all performed together towards a common high level goal products have to provide support for both activities and the various tasks that are involved

**Law of product development

>  the data Product development process starts it is behind schedule and  above budget

  
Complexity is good it is confusion that is bad

**Iterative Design Process:**

- Don Norman emphasizes the iterative nature of design, involving repeated cycles of improvement and refinement. He argues that designers should engage in the design process from the initial concept to the final product.

**Design Thinking vs. Theoretical Thinking:**

- Norman draws a distinction between design thinking, focused on solving real-world problems and improving usability, and theoretical thinking, which is more concerned with abstract principles and ideals. He advocates for a design thinking approach in practical design.

**Understanding Users:**

- At the core of successful design is a deep understanding of users. Designers must grasp the users' needs, goals, and mental models. To achieve this, Norman recommends observing users, engaging in conversations, and empathizing with their experiences.

**Affordances and Signifiers:**

- Norman reiterates the importance of affordances (clues that suggest how an object should be used) and signifiers (indicators that provide information about an object's functionality). Good design should make these elements clear and intuitive, helping users understand how to interact with a product.

**Rapid Prototyping:**

- Prototyping and testing are critical components of design. Norman advises designers to create quick, low-cost prototypes that allow for early feedback. This iterative approach helps designers identify potential issues, improve designs, and respond to user needs effectively.

**Psychological Models:**

- Norman introduces the concept of a psychological model, which is the mental representation users have of how a product works. A successful design ensures that users' psychological models align with the actual system model, resulting in intuitive and user-friendly experiences.

**Collaboration:**

- Effective design teams should be interdisciplinary, with members from various backgrounds and expertise. Collaborative efforts bring diverse perspectives to the design process and contribute to well-rounded solutions.

**The Role of Evaluation:**

- Evaluation and testing with real users are integral to the design process. Evaluations help designers identify usability issues and refine designs based on user feedback. Continuous testing and refinement are essential components of successful design.

**Design for Both Novices and Experts:**

- Designers should consider the needs of both novice and expert users. Well-designed products accommodate beginners while allowing experts to use shortcuts and access advanced features. This approach ensures a broad user base.

**Feedback Loops:**

- Norman discusses the concept of feedback loops in design, where users interact with a system and receive feedback about their actions. Effective design ensures that these feedback loops are clear, informative, and provide guidance to users.

In summary, Chapter 6 underscores the significance of a human-centered, iterative design approach. It encourages designers to deeply understand users, create prototypes for early testing, refine products based on feedback, and develop user-friendly solutions aligned with users' mental models. Norman advocates for designers to actively engage with users throughout the design process to ensure that the final product is both usable and valuable. Design thinking requires empathy, collaboration, and ongoing interaction with users to deliver successful designs.
