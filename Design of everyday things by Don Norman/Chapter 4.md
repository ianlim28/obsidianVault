<h2>Knowing what to do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback</h2>

1. **Constraints:**
    
    - **Physical Constraints:** These are the physical properties of objects that prevent certain actions. For example, a USB plug can only be inserted in one orientation due to its physical shape, preventing errors.
    - **Logical Constraints:** Logical constraints rely on logical relationships. A well-designed microwave, for instance, prevents contradictory actions. It won't allow you to set both the time and temperature, which is illogical.
    - **Cultural Constraints:** These constraints are based on societal conventions and expectations. They ensure that users understand how to interact with a product based on cultural standards. For example, a red button typically signifies stopping or an emergency action.
2. **Discoverability:**
    - Discoverability is the design feature that allows users to learn about a system's functions through exploration and experimentation.
    - Well-designed products provide clues and cues that guide users towards discovering the product's features and functionality.
    - Discoverability is particularly crucial when dealing with unfamiliar interfaces or new technology. It helps users build a mental model of how the system works.
3. **Feedback:**
    - Feedback is information provided to users that informs them about the results of their actions.
    - Feedback can be visual, auditory, or tactile. For example, pressing a key on a keyboard provides tactile and auditory feedback.
    - Immediate and informative feedback is essential in helping users understand the system's status and the consequences of their actions.
4. **Mapping and Natural Mapping:**
    - Mapping is the relationship between controls and their effects. In well-designed systems, the mapping between controls and outcomes should be natural and intuitive.
    - Natural mapping reduces the cognitive load on users by aligning the control's physical or logical layout with the expected behavior.
    - An example of natural mapping is a car's steering wheel: turning it left makes the vehicle go left.
5. **Constraints and Error Prevention:**
    - Constraints are essential in reducing errors. They limit the actions users can take, guiding them toward correct interactions and away from potential mistakes.

6. **Affordances Revisited:**
    - Affordances are perceived or actual features of an object that suggest how it can be used. Designers should consider the affordances of a product and ensure they align with users' expectations.
    - Effective design highlights the affordances that are relevant to users and makes them easily discoverable.
7. **Visibility of System Status:**
    - Users need to know the system's current state and the results of their actions.
    - Feedback should make the system's status visible and ensure users are informed. It prevents confusion and reduces errors.

In this chapter, Don Norman emphasizes that good design should incorporate *constraints*, *discoverability*, and *feedback* to create products and systems that are intuitive and user-friendly. By following these principles, designers can help users understand what actions are possible, how to perform them, and receive clear feedback about the outcomes. This results in better user experiences and fewer errors.
