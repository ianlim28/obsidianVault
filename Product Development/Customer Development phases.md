1. **Discovery:** Identifying initial customer segments and understanding their potential needs. This phase focuses on hypothesizing problems that customers face and envisioning potential solutions.
2. **Validation:** Testing hypotheses from the Discovery phase with real customers to confirm that the problems and solutions identified are valid. This phase is crucial for determining whether there's a market for the product.
3. **Creation:** Developing a minimum viable product (MVP) based on validated customer needs and feedback. This phase involves iterative cycles of testing and refining the product.
4. **Building:** Scaling the product and business processes after confirming the product's fit in the market and its viability.

**Customer Interview Techniques**
**Purpose:**
- To gather insights directly from customers about their experiences, needs, and perceptions.
- To validate hypotheses about customer problems and solutions, and to refine product offerings based on real user feedback.

**Types of Interviews:**
1. **Exploratory Interview:**
    - **Objective:** To identify if customers have certain pain points and are receptive to potential solutions.
    - **Approach:** Conversational and open-ended, aiming to explore customer experiences and gather insights.
    - **Questions:**
        - "What’s the worst part of your commute?"
        - "When you get lost while driving, what do you do?"
2. **Validation Interview:**
    - **Objective:** To test specific hypotheses about customer problems and the proposed value of your product.
    - **Approach:** Scientific and unbiased, minimizing leading questions to avoid influencing the responses.
    - **Questions:**
        - Questions are deferred until after discussing their experiences in detail, ensuring feedback is unbiased and genuine.
3. **Satisfaction-Oriented Interview:**
    - **Objective:** To understand customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.
    - **Approach:** Focuses on the customer’s feelings about the product and their experiences using it.
    - **Questions:**
        - "What should we stop doing?"
        - "How can we improve our product to better meet your needs?"
4. **Efficiency Interview:**
    - **Objective:** To determine how the product could be optimized to better fulfill its intended purpose.
    - **Approach:** Identifies usage patterns and explores functionality and feature effectiveness.
    - **Questions:**
        - "How easy is it for you to use feature X?"
        - "If you needed to accomplish Y, how would you go about it using our product?"


Going from exploratory to validation to satisfaction to efficiency question evolution
1. what do you do when you  can't cook at home?
2. when ordering for delivery do you order from the same restaurants?
3. what would make you order from the same restaurant?
4. is it easy for you to log in and use your rewards points for the restaurants you usually order from?

**General Tips for Conducting Customer Interviews:**

- Ask open-ended questions to elicit detailed responses.
- Listen more than you speak to capture the customer's true feelings and thoughts.
- Avoid bias by not leading the customer or defending the product during the interview.
- Combine different types of interview questions to capture a comprehensive view of the customer experience.


### Key Differences in Customer Development

**Approach by Stage:**
- Customer development evolves throughout the life cycle of a product.
- The guiding principles of customer development remain consistent, but the type of information gathered and the approach to gathering it vary depending on the product stage.

**Stages of Customer Development:**
1. **Pre-Product:**
    - **Focus:** Concentrate on understanding potential customers who are not yet familiar with the brand or product.
    - **Challenges:** These customers are harder to reach and may not immediately understand the product's potential value.
    - **Primary Goals:** Identify pain points and validate the product concept.
2. **Post-Product:**
    - **Focus:** Engage with existing customers who already have some experience with the product.
    - **Advantages:** These customers are easier to reach and can provide insights based on actual usage.
    - **Primary Goals:** Focus on customer satisfaction, usability, and ongoing pain points.

**Identifying Target Groups:**
- Determine who the target customers are based on whether the product is in the pre-product or post-product stage.
- Tailor the customer development approach accordingly.

**Detailed Strategies:**
1. **Pre-Product Stage:**
    - **Objective:** Validation of the product idea and market demand.
    - **Targeting Customers:**
        - If you have identified a potential customer group, focus your efforts on understanding their specific needs and how well your product concept meets these needs.
        - If the target customer group is not defined, conduct exploratory research to identify potential groups.
    - **Exercise: '3 Question Study':**
        - Write down at least three types of potential customer groups.
        - Identify the problem your product solves and determine which groups experience this problem.
        - Create a matrix to evaluate these groups based on three criteria: market size, pain level related to the problem, and accessibility.
        - Example matrix setup:
            - Columns: Customer Groups
            - Rows: Criteria (Size, Pain: Payment, Accessibility)
            - Rate each criterion on a scale from 1 to 10 and sum the scores to prioritize target groups.

|               |         |         |         |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|               | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 |
| Size          | 3       | 2       | 6       |
| Pain: Payment | 10      | 7       | 4       |
| Accessibility | 8       | 5       | 5       |
|               | 21      | 14      | 15      |
Group 1are they people you should be going for because you have the highest chances of reaching out to them.

1. **Post-Product Stage:**
    - **Objective:** Enhance product features and customer experience based on feedback from existing users.
    - **Selecting Interviewees:**
        - Choose from your established customer base those who are actively using and engaging with the product.
        - Use demographic data and user behavior to filter and select the most relevant group for specific feedback.
**Conclusion:**
- In both stages, the chosen approach should align with the primary objectives: validating the product in the pre-product stage and enhancing the product in the post-product stage.
- Effective customer development requires adapting strategies to the maturity of the product and the familiarity of the customers.

**4. Twitter (Post-Product):**
