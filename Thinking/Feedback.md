**Roses, Thorns and Buds**

Giving feedback in a ==[Rose, Thorn, Bud](https://www.mindfulschools.org/inspiration/mindful-reflection/)== format is one of the simplest ways to ==[make sure we offer feedback effectively](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764203260208?journalCode=absb)====. A rose is something that’s positive, working well. Starting with Roses creates ease. Thorns are gaps, clear negative issues. After roses, people can be open to hearing the thorns. Ending feedback with buds, areas of potential growth that are present but not fully realized, leaves the person with solid, positive next actions, based on what they’re already doing.\

There’s [plenty of research that backs positive reinforcement.](https://sharpencx.com/blog/positive-and-negative-feedback-ratio/) There’s even [research that suggests that top-performing teams give positive feedback 5 times more than constructive criticism](https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-ideal-praise-to-criticism). A five to one ratio! That’s a worthy reach goal.
